# HPBDAIS_final_project
fMRI Parcellation and Analysis System

## Overview
This project aims to develop a system for simulating different fMRI parcellations and analyzing them using various strategies. The goal is to explore the performance of different packages, such as sklearn and cuML, on both CPU and GPU platforms. Additionally, the project will investigate methods like parallelization to enhance the efficiency of the time-consuming analysis process.
